# HuffmanCodingAlgorithm
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that was invented by
David Huffman in 1952. The algorithm works by assigning variable-length
codes to different symbols in a given message, where the length of each code
is inversely proportional to the frequency of the corresponding symbol.
